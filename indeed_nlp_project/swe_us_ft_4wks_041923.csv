Founding Software Engineer,Tephra Labs,"New York, NY","$156,000 - $204,000 a year",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=c0ba2cce6cd09d41&fccid=dd616958bd9ddc12&vjs=3,"What we do
Tephra Labs is a product lab developing critical infrastructure for large-scale human coordination. Our first product is a decentralized talent marketplace, protocol, and network called Radius. On the Radius network, users own their work history and reputation and are naturally incentivized to make their working engagements successful.
We are a team of builders with deep experience in web3 and marketplaces. We recently raised a $5m seed round to support the Tephra Labs mission.
What we believe
Our beliefs are core to everything we do:
Independent and flexible work will be the dominant form of work in the future.
Some studies estimate that more than 50% of the US workforce will be freelancers by 2027, and the majority of GenZ workers today are already independent workers.
The solutions that exist to match independent workers to meaningful opportunities are insufficient to meet the needs of the growing independent workforce.
Traditional talent marketplaces, staffing agencies/platforms, bounty platforms, etc. fail to provide independent workers with significant opportunities and to ensure high-quality work outputs for employers.
Decentralized ecosystems have the potential to reach unprecedented scales and achieve significant impact, greater than any centralized organizations in history.
Decentralized ecosystems will be powered by independent workers.
Effectively enabling governments, corporations, and individuals to work together will allow us to solve pervasive and long-standing challenges facing humanity, such as climate change, cancer, access to education, and more.
Why we’re different
We’re not like other startups. Here are some of the reasons we are different:
We pride ourselves on responsible growth. We’re keeping our team lean and focused on achieving product-market fit and exponential adoption. You’ll join a tight-knit and talented team that’s laser focused on impact (see below).
We are laser focused on our massive potential for impact. We have a clear north star, and we’re adaptive and relentless in our pursuit. The impact we seek isn’t limited to one industry, solution, or set of technologies. We’re planning to make our first dent in the web3 space, and expand to other industries and other solutions over time.
We care deeply about our people. We want our teammates to show up to work as their full selves. We care about you, the whole you, before everything else. We provide competitive pay, excellent benefits, and great perks for you and your family.
Who we’re looking for
Founding Software Engineer
You’ll have the opportunity to work across frontend, backend, and protocol design/engineering – based on your skill sets and interests. You will also drive critical technical architecture and decisions for Radius and future Tephra Labs products and protocols.
What you’ll need:
Passion for the Tephra Labs mission and vision
Demonstrated engineering experience
Extreme desire to grow and learn
Excited to work in PT, MT, CT, OR ET hours
While we are a remote and distributed team, the founding group will need to be in high-sync as we scale!
Compensation
We’re proud to offer competitive compensation across salary, equity/tokens, benefits, and other perks:
Base salary range: $156,000 - $204,000/year

We’re a medium-sized company that’s growing rapidly, but which maintains that small company feel. At Performance, you’re not just a name & face or locked onto a fixed team maintaining legacy systems; instead, you’ll be working on a wide variety of projects using the full gamut of advanced software development technologies.
We provide what great talent wants and deserves!

Last year, we launched Collectible Avatars in partnership with independent artists to bring unique designs and benefits to collectible owners. While we have onboarded millions of users to the initiatives, we are in the beginning of our journey. If there is one thing we've noticed with digital collectibles is that they have an incredible power to create a sense of participation and belonging. With each project, a vibrant community of owners pops up with it. Fans of today's biggest creators and brands are now flocking to buy digital goods directly from them - to support them, to gain exclusive access, and to feel a greater sense of connection with them. Over time, collectibles will play a central role in how fans support their favorite creators and communities on Reddit and beyond.

Experience developing customer-facing public applications is preferred.
Experience with payment processing systems is a plus.
Entrepreneurial spirit. On our team, everyone needs to act like a startup CEO. You must be self-directed, innovative, and biased towards action in fast-paced environments. You live to build new things and thrive in ambiguity and even failure.
Excellent communication skills. You must be able to collaborate effectively with teams in a fully-remote environment, and discuss complex topics with technical and non-technical audiences.

Being proactive in exploring new tools, technologies and ways of working

What we are looking for:
Strong programming skills in any language. We look for strong Engineers and our philosophy is that a strong Engineer is not defined by the technologies they use; therefore Ruby experience is not essential. You’ll just need to be happy to cross-over to Ruby if you join us – and we will support you with that
Familiarity with Agile
Strong desire to work collaboratively with business teams. We do not divide ‘business’ and tech’ teams, we see both as one team as we are all working towards one shared goal

Simply Business is an equal opportunity employer. We're committed to welcoming and helping to grow employees within an inclusive & diverse culture. And that commitment starts with our interview process.

Once you apply, your info will be reviewed in a committee with employees from different levels, teams, and experiences. We pride ourselves on fostering a sense of community, which is only made stronger by each individual at SB, so you'll have the opportunity to meet a variety of people throughout the process. Get excited!

What's going on with work from home and return to the office?

More and more, people are talking about going back to the workplace and the new normal. At Simply Business, we’re thinking of it as a Better Normal. That means offering our SBers more choice and greater flexibility to work in a way that’s best for their particular job, their teams, and their lives.

We’re shifting to a hybrid working model, so we’ll have employees working virtually and in the office at any given time.

We’re also aware there are times when working together in person is the best way to get things done. We expect our SBers to connect in their hubs (that’s what we call our offices) most likely four times a month. That said, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution, so we expect all SBers and their teams will find the operating rhythm that works best for them.

If you’re wondering what it might be like for you at Simply Business, our Talent Acquisition is happy to answer any questions. In fact for them, it’s perfectly normal.

Most of our interviews will still take place over Zoom (however, depending on the role, there may be the opportunity/expectation to meet members of the team in-person). If it looks like you could be a good fit for the role, we’ll ask you to interview on Zoom – you’ll need WiFi and a laptop, or a 4G-enabled smartphone. If you don’t have access to either of these, or you need support with your application, get in touch with us at uscareers@simplybusiness.com. Similarly, please email us with any questions or if you want to pause your application for a bit – we’ll be happy to keep you updated on future opportunities like the one above."

About the company / organization

Our client helps artists capture more value from their music and help fans directly support the artists they love. It builds connections between artists and fans by enabling fans to buy song NFTs which allow them to become part of an interactive community. The one metric that matters with us is how many artists make a full-time living off their music alone. Tees, tours, and fan clubs can offer incremental revenue for artists, but shouldn't come at the expense of creating art. Well constantly listen, learn, and make adjustments as we work towards building a totally different kind of music industry that puts artists and listeners first. Our vision for the future is ambitious: we want to honor the value of music by giving a million artists the opportunity to live off their art.
